		<h1>Pluralsight Skills</h1>
		<h2>
			Where teams build better <br />
			technology skills, faster
		</h2>
		<p>
			Technology teams are only as successful as their skills are relevant.
			<br />
			Give them access to Pluralsight Skills—courses, assessments, learning
			paths, and labs <br />
			and you give them the tech fluency they need to build business-critical
			skills.<brn />
